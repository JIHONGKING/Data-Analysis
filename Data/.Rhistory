**Compute** a new vector of each Star Wars character's "body-mass index", or BMI. Let this vector be **printed as output**, do not save it.
To compute a character's BMI, take their mass in kilograms and divide it by their squared height in meters. `sw_mass` is already in kilograms, but `sw_heights` is in centimeters. 1 meter equals 100 centimeters.
*More information on BMI can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/training/bmiage/page5_1.html).*
The first BMI in the vector, Luke Skywalker's, should be about 26. (*Make sure your BMI's are on the right scale; they shouldn't all be less than 1 or greater than 100!*)
